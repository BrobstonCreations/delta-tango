## Delta Tango Assembly

Tools:
- M3x0.5 Tap
- M3 Allen Key

Fasteners:
- (4) M3x0.5 6mm Long Flat Head Machine Screws Inner Hex Screw
- (2) M3x0.5 10mm (type isn't super important)


Assembly:
- Use the M3x0.5 tap to tap threads in the four holes of the enclosure, as well as two holes, one in each probe mount for the set-screw.
- In order to insert the ESP8266 D1 Mini and DC Power Shield into the enclosure. The wifi antenna end of the ESP8266 D1 Mini needs angled down at a 45 degree angle and slid to the back corner of the case. If the antenna end is all the way in the corner, the board should be able to flip down into the enclosure.
- Pass both sets of DS18B20 Temperature Sensor Probe wires through the side opening of the electronics enclosure.
- Align the electronics enclosure lid onto the top of the enclosure.
- Install the four M3x0.5 machine screws. Take care to be sure that the wires are clamped tight enough to not move in or out.
- Slide the DS18B20 Temperature Sensor Probe ends through the probe mounts; do this for both probes.
- Install the set screw in the probe mount; this should need to be more than hand-tight. The goal here is to keep the probe in the mount; the probe should be a friction fit in the mount.
