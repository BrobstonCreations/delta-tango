## Implementation Options

1. Home Assistant through ESPHome.
2. Home Assistant through MQTT.
3. In the future, this project: [MQTT HVAC Vent Control](https://github.com/TonyBrobston/mqtt-hvac-vent-control) will likely be ported to a Home Assistant Integration and the Delta Tango project will be a safety feature to ensure that you don't freeze your evaporator coil or crack your heat exchanger.

*If you know of some other options, feel free to add them here.*
