## Electronics Assembly 

The next time I assemble one of these, I'll take some pictures to add.
1. Snap off header pins from one of the header pin blocks that came with your components. You will need a header pin for 5V, GND, D6, 3V3, and RST. The first four are needed, the RST pin is just to add rigidity between the D1 Mini and the DC Power Shield.
2. I would recommend pressing these header pins into a breadboard (long side down) in the correct pattern for 5V, GND, and RST pins on the D1 Mini; this will make soldering the pins to the D1 mini much easier.
3. Press the D1 Mini on to the pins in the breadboard.
4. Solder the pins to the D1 Mini.
5. Once these pins are soldered, I would recommend removing the D1 Mini from the breadboard and clip it into a [third hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helping_hand_(tool)).
6. From the bottom side of the D1 Mini, insert one leg of the 4.7k Resistor through 3V3 and the other leg through D6.
