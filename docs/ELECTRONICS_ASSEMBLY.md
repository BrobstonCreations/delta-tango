## Electronics Assembly 

1. Snap off header pins from one of the header pin blocks that came with your components. You will need a header pin for 5V, GND, and RST. The RST pin is just to add rigidity between the D1 Mini and the DC Power Shield.
2. I would recommend pressing these header pins into a breadboard (long side down) in the correct pattern for 5V, GND, and RST pins on the D1 Mini; this will make soldering the pins to the D1 mini much easier.
3. Press the D1 Mini on to the pins in the breadboard.
4. Solder the pins to the D1 Mini.
5. Once these pins are soldered, I would recommend removing the D1 Mini from the breadboard and clip it into a [third hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helping_hand_(tool)).
6. From the bottom side of the D1 Mini, insert one leg of the 4.7k Resistor through 3V3 and the other leg through D6.
7. With the resistor as tight as possible to the bottom of the D1 Mini, solder both 3V3 and D6 in place.
8. Now you should be able to press the DC Power Shield onto the pins you soldered to the D1 Mini. Be sure to insert the [spacer](https://www.printables.com/model/259295-esp-shield-solder-spacer) before soldering.
9. Solder the pins and resistor legs to the DC Power Shield.
10. Remove the spacer.
11. Strip 1/4 of an inch of insulation off the end of each wire on both DS18B20 Temperature Sensor Probes.
12. Twist the exposed wiring for each matching pair (red, yellow, black) together.
13. Tin the wires on both DS18B20's and each of the corresponding pins on the top of the Power Shield (3V3, D6, and GND).
14. I would recommend clipping the D1 back into the [third hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helping_hand_(tool)).
15. Solder the red pair to 3V3, the yellow pair to D6, and the black pair to GND; be sure that these wires cannot make connection with any other pin or wire.
