# Delta Tango

This project contains most everything needed to 3D print, assemble, and flash an ESPHome Delta T monitoring tool. This measures the temperature difference between HVAC return air and supply air. 

*This monitoring will help ensure you don't freeze your evaporator coil or crack your heater exchanger.*
